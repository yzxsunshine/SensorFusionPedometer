SensorFusionPedometer
=====================

It's a half-finished project and not likely to build more stuff on ... 

I merged and modified 3 open source projects which are public domain codes together.
One of them is https://github.com/bagilevi/android-pedometer
Another one is from a book source code which is eligible for any kind of use.
The third one is from this blog which is MIT-License, http://www.thousand-thoughts.com/2012/03/android-sensor-fusion-tutorial/

So feel free to make use of it~~
